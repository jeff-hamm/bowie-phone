# Config Selector Feature - Summary

## What Was Added

Users visiting **phone.infinitebutts.com** directly (without a cookie) now see an elegant modal asking them to choose between Bowie Phone and BroPhone.

## How It Works

### Detection Logic

The system detects "direct access" when ALL of these are true:
1. ✅ On main site (phone.infinitebutts.com)
2. ✅ No `phone-config` cookie set
3. ✅ No session storage entry
4. ✅ NOT referred by redirect sites (bowie-phone or brophone.infinitebutts.com)

### User Experience

**First-Time Visitor (No Cookie)**:
```
User → phone.infinitebutts.com
  ↓
Modal appears: "Select Your Phone System"
  ├─ 📞 Bowie Phone (Green theme • Original sequences)
  └─ 📱 BroPhone (Blue theme • Alternative sequences)
  ↓
User clicks option
  ↓
Cookie set → Page reloads → Config loads
```

**Returning Visitor (Has Cookie)**:
```
User → phone.infinitebutts.com
  ↓
Cookie found → Config loads directly (no modal)
```

**Via Redirect Site**:
```
User → bowie-phone.infinitebutts.com
  ↓
Cookie set → Redirect to main site
  ↓
Main site loads (no modal, already has cookie)
```

## Visual Design

The modal features:
- **Dark overlay** (70% opacity) - focuses attention
- **White card** centered on screen
- **Smooth animations** - fade in + slide up
- **Two large buttons**:
  - Icons (📞 and 📱)
  - Config name
  - Description
- **Hover effects** - blue border + slight shift right
- **Mobile responsive** - 90% width on small screens

## Code Changes

### Modified Files

**config-manager.js**:
- Added `isDirectAccess()` method - detects if selector needed
- Added `showConfigSelector()` method - creates and displays modal
- Added `selectConfig()` method - handles user selection
- Added `init()` method - orchestrates initialization
- Added session storage support - backup if cookies cleared
- Updated `loadConfig()` - checks for direct access scenario

## Benefits

### For Users:
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Can access main site directly and still choose config
- ✅ **No confusion**: Clear, visual selection instead of "wrong" default
- ✅ **Persistent**: Choice saved for 365 days
- ✅ **Fast**: Only shows once, then remembers

### For Admins:
- ✅ **Three ways to set config**:
  1. Visit redirect sites
  2. Use config selector modal
  3. Use config-switcher.html admin tool
- ✅ **Smart detection**: Won't show unnecessarily
- ✅ **Session backup**: Works even if cookies temporarily cleared

### For SEO/Marketing:
- ✅ **Single main URL**: Can promote phone.infinitebutts.com
- ✅ **User choice**: Let users decide which system they want
- ✅ **No forced redirect**: Direct links work properly

## Edge Cases Handled

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| First visit, no cookie | ✅ Shows selector modal |
| Has cookie | ❌ No selector, loads config |
| Came from redirect site | ❌ No selector, already has config |
| Cookie cleared mid-session | ❌ No selector, uses sessionStorage |
| Direct URL in bookmark | ✅ Shows selector if no cookie |
| Shared link | ✅ Shows selector if recipient has no cookie |
| On redirect site itself | ❌ No selector, redirects immediately |

## Testing

See [TESTING_CONFIG_SELECTOR.md](TESTING_CONFIG_SELECTOR.md) for comprehensive test scenarios.

**Quick Test**:
1. Clear cookies and sessionStorage
2. Visit phone.infinitebutts.com
3. Should see modal with two options
4. Click one
5. Page reloads with selected config

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Redirect sites still work exactly the same
- ✅ Existing cookies still work
- ✅ Config-switcher.html still works
- ✅ All existing configs load normally
- ✅ No breaking changes to app.js or other files

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions:
- Add "Remember my choice" checkbox
- Add "Don't show again" option
- Add more configs to selector dynamically
- Add config descriptions from SITE_CONFIGS
- Add preview/demo of each config
- Add keyboard navigation (arrow keys + enter)
- Add analytics to track which config users choose

## Summary

This feature makes the system more user-friendly by:
1. **Removing the barrier** of needing to know about redirect sites
2. **Providing clear choice** when visiting the main URL
3. **Maintaining flexibility** while keeping convenience
4. **Not disrupting** existing workflows

Users can now discover and choose their config naturally, while power users can still use redirect sites or the admin switcher.
